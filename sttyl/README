Notes:

The word wrapper (1) does the wrapping in place, simply replacing a specified
character (or the one next to it) with a CR, and (2) is consequently not smart 
enough to break up words if the number of columns is less than the length of 
the word being output; in this case, it'll wrap after the next word
