Design Document for more03
-----------------------------------------------------------
Code by: Yuri Machkasov
Date: 01/30/2018
History: Version 0.1
-----------------------------------------------------------

Purpose:

The purpose of more03 is to extend the 'more02' version of more
by adding new features:

   [a] no need to press Enter to have program receive a keystroke
   [b] program will work in any size terminal window
   [c] program will work if window is resized when program is running

Ouline:

The program still has a main loop that reads the command line and processes
files named there.  If no files are named on the command line, the program
pages through data read from stdin.

For each file, the program shows one screenful of lines, then asks the user
what to do, reads a keystroke from the user.  Depending on the key pressed,
the program quits, shows one more line of text, or shows one more screenful
of text, then asks again.

Features:
To accomodate direct input of control characters, the program no longer reads user commands from standard input, utilizing instead the file descriptor for tty (through the utility function rawgetc ())
The size of the terminal is no longer hardcoded, and is read instead from the system environment on startup (through the utility function get_term_size ())
The number of lines to display for the next page of input (that is, when user chooses a space) is also dynamically calculated using the query for the screen size at each user interaction.

Layering:

	main ,for each file, calls:
		do_more	-- which pages through a file calling
			how_much_more -- to ask user how much more to show

File Structure:

	more03.c	-- the main three functions listed above, with the addition of two wrappers, pagelen () and pagewidth (),
			around the utility function providing terminal size
	termfuncs.c	-- a toolkit that provides access to terminal info and input
