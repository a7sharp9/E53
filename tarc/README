Summary:

  This submission contains the files:

    tarc.c     -- the main () function as well as the wrapper for
                 archiving files on the command line in sequence
    tarutils.h -- constants, message formats and signatures for the
                  publicly visible functions from tarutils.c
    tarutils.c -- the principal logic for formatting correct archive entries
                  for files or directories
    msgutils.h -- signatures for the publicly visible functions from
                  msgutils.c
    Makefile   -- the makefile; builds the target and provides for the
                   testing (target "make test")
    Plan       -- a description of the design and operation of my code
    typescript -- a sample run, including the result of the test script
                  and some boundary conditions not covered (a name that is
                  too long and an attempt to archive a character device)
    README     -- this file

  Please set tabstop to 4 to view.

Notes:

The utilities in msgutils assume that we are dealing with one file at a time -
that write_file () in tarutils.c, which initializes, uses and deconstructs the
messaging system, is never called in parallel.
